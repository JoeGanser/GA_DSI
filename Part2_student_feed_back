STUDENT 1:

There is no need to import numpy
Line 5 should be
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
Line 6 should be
from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score
Line 8 specifies the data. When referencing the data, we need to consistently use the same label for it. In line 12 and 13 data is used, but this should actually be d
Lines 20, 21 aren't necessary, you already imported cross val score and you aren't using train-test split
Line 22, you need a cv>1 and scoring should be 'neg_mean_absolute_error'.


STUDENT 2:


Line 2: No need to import numpy
Line 20: should be 'neg_mean_absolute_error'
